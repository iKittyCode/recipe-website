    "ingredients": [
        "1 (3 pound) whole chicken, including neck and giblets, cut into 1-inch pieces",
        "2 cups water (Optional)",
        "¼ cup lemon juice",
        "3 cups chopped Bermuda onion",
        "3 tablespoons butter",
        "½ teaspoon cayenne pepper",
        "1 teaspoon paprika",
        "½ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "¼ teaspoon ground ginger",
        "1 cup water, or as needed (Optional)",
        "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (Optional)",
        "2 tablespoons water (Optional)",

    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Soak the chicken in 2 cups water and lemon juice in a large bowl for 10 minutes. Drain.",
        "Step 2: Place the onion, with no fat, in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until very dark, about 20 minutes. Stir in the butter, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, and ginger, then stir in 1 more cup of water. Add the drained chicken, stirring until well-blended. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour. If a thicker stew is desired, whisk flour with 2 tablespoons of water, and stir into the pot; allow to simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in eggs; cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes more."
