        "Step 1: Make dipping sauce: Combine garlic, smoked paprika, and salt in a mortar and pestle or food processor; process until smooth. Mix in mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, tomato paste, chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper until combined. Cover and refrigerate sauce.",
        "Step 2: Make spice blend: Mix together salt, black pepper, paprika, and chipotle chile powder in a small bowl. Set aside.",
        "Step 3: Make potatoes: Pour water into a large saucepan. Stir salt, smoked paprika, cumin, and bay leaves into water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover; simmer for 10 minutes.",
        "Step 4: Stir potatoes into seasoned water, bring to a boil, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not fully cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. The tip of a paring knife should easily insert into the center of a potato cube. Drain potatoes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.",
        "Step 5: Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Step 6: Add cooled potato cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to cool slightly. Toss in a bowl with spice blend and serve with dipping sauce.",
