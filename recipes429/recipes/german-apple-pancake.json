        "Step 3: Melt butter in a 10-inch oven-proof skillet, brushing butter up on the sides of the pan. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg in a small bowl; sprinkle sugar mixture over the butter. Line the pan with apple slices. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup sugar over apples. Place pan over medium-high heat until the mixture bubbles, then gently pour batter mixture over apples.",
