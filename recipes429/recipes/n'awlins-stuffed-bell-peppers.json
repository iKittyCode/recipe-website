    "method": [
        "Step 1: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).",
        "Step 2: Heat oil in a large pot over low heat. Saute onion, celery and chopped green pepper for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and saute for 2 minutes. Season with parsley, Creole seasoning, file powder, salt and pepper.",
        "Step 3: Increase heat to medium high, and add ground beef. Cook until beef is evenly browned. Stir in ham, and cook for 5 minutes. Add shrimp, and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in stuffing mix.",
        "Step 4: Stuff each bell pepper half, and lightly sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Place stuffed bell pepper halves in ungreased baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.",
        "Step 5: Because the stuffing is fully cooked prior to baking, you can reduce the baking time by half (30 to 35 minutes) if you blanch the bell peppers in boiling water for 3 minutes before stuffing."
