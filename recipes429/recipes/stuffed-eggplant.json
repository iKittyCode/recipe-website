        "Step 1: Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.",
        "Step 2: Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces.",
        "Step 3: Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper; set aside.",
        "Step 4: Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and basil. Add pasta sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.",
        "Step 5: Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing.",
        "Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.",
        "Step 7: This recipe was tested in our test kitchen in May 2023 and updated to bake for 45 minutes. We used less bread crumbs, and added 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, chopped onion, and tomato-basil sauce."
