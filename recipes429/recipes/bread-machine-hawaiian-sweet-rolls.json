    "method": [
        "Step 1: Place pineapple juice, milk, egg, butter, coconut extract, bread flour, potato flakes, sugar, salt, ginger, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed, or according to manufacturer's instructions. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough after cycle has ended, about 1 hour.",
        "Step 2: Form dough into rolls; place on a baking sheet and let rise for 1 hour.",
        "Step 3: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.",
        "Step 5: You can use vanilla extract instead of coconut extract.",
        "Step 6: You can freeze individual rolls before baking. Simply thaw frozen rolls and let rise, then bake as instructed.",
        "Step 7: We discovered that we like these rolls to be baked apart rather than squished in a pan like in my photo."
