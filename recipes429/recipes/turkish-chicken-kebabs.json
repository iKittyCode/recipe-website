    "method": [
        "Step 1: Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.",
        "Step 2: Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.",
        "Step 3: Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Step 4: Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick \"log\" shape.",
        "Step 5: Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
