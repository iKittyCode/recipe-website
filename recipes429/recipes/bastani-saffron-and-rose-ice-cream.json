    "ingredients": [
        "5 large egg yolks",
        "1/2 cup sugar",
        "5 1/2 cups whole milk",
        "2 tablespoons rose water",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed to a powder",
        "1 1/2 cups whipping cream",
        "1/3 cup pistachios",

    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until thick and pale yellow, 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Step 2: Warm the milk, rose water, and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat just until mixture lightly simmers. Gradually pour milk mixture into yolk mixture, whisking constantly.",
        "Step 3: Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) and mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Add saffron, stirring until mixture takes on a deep-yellow color, about 1 minute. Stir in whipping cream. Cover surface with plastic wrap; chill at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.",
        "Step 4: Churn mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturerâ€™s directions until it reaches the texture of soft-serve ice cream. Add pistachios (if using) during the last few minutes of churning.",
        "Step 5: Transfer to a freezer-safe container, cover surface with parchment paper, and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.",
        "Step 6: Scoop into bowls. Garnish with pistachios and rose petals. (Freeze in an airtight container up to 1 week.)"
