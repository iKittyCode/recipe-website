    "ingredients": [
        "2 cups lukewarm water",
        "Â¼ cup white sugar",
        "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast",
        "7 cups all-purpose flour",

    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and bubbles slightly, about 5 minutes.",
        "Step 2: Sift together flour and salt in a large bowl.",
        "Step 3: Pour yeast mixture over flour mixture and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover bowl with a clean cloth and let dough rise until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.",
        "Step 4: Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a tennis ball; roll until smooth. Flatten ball of dough until it is palm-sized; set aside on a floured work surface. Repeat with remaining dough.",
        "Step 5: Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Step 6: Fry in hot oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
        "Step 7: We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used."
