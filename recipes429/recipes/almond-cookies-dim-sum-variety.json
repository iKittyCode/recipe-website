    "ingredients": [
        "red food coloring",
        "1 cup vegetable shortening, plus",
        "3 tablespoons vegetable shortening",
        "1 cup sugar",
        "1  egg, beaten",
        "1 teaspoon almond extract",
        "2 ½ cups all-purpose flour",
        "½ teaspoon baking soda",
        "½ teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour a few drops of red food coloring into a small bowl, and set aside.",
        "Step 2: With an electric mixer, beat the shortening together with the sugar in a mixing bowl until creamy. Beat in the egg and almond extract.",
        "Step 3: In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar-shortening mixture, and mix well. Scoop up a scant tablespoon of dough with a spoon, and form into a walnut-sized ball. Place the ball onto an ungreased cookie sheet, and press the ball slightly with your thumb to create a flat spot on top (don't flatten the cookie). Dip the end of a bamboo chopstick into the red food coloring, and touch the center of each cookie to make a red dot.",
        "Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on a rack."
