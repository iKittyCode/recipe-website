        "Step 1: Gather all ingredients.",
        "Step 2: Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in yeast and sugar and let dissolve.",
        "Step 3: Add 2 teaspoons olive oil, salt, and bread flour. Knead mixture together with a dough hook attachment until dough is very smooth, soft, and elastic.",
        "Step 4: Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape.",
        "Step 5: Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.",
        "Step 6: Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.",
        "Step 7: Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C). Combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into bowl. Toss lightly to mix together.",
        "Step 8: Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into a rectangle that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch dough up the sides about 1/2 inch or so.",
        "Step 9: Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese evenly over top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where dough meets the pan.",
        "Step 10: Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.",
        "Step 11: Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.",
        "Step 12: Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into rectangular pieces.",
        "Step 13: Serve immediately and enjoy!",
