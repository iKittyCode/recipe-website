Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Stir in the soy bean paste, coating the beef. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Gently drop tofu into the soup and continue cooking until the tofu is heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly add the egg into the soup, stirring gently to break it up.
