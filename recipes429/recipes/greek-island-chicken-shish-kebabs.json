        "Step 1: Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, cumin, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.",
        "Step 2: Meanwhile, soak wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before use.",
        "Step 3: Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Step 4: Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess liquid; discard remaining marinade. Alternately thread chicken with bell peppers, onion, tomatoes, and mushrooms onto the skewers.",
        "Step 5: Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until nicely browned on all sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
