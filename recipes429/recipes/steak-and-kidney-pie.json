        "Step 1: Remove fat and membrane from the kidneys; cut them in half and remove any white tissue in the center; dice into chunky pieces.",
        "Step 2: Heat butter or lard in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced kidney and steak; cook and stir until beef is browned. Stir in onions and season with salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir in 1 ½ cups water; simmer until beef is almost tender, about 1 hour.",
        "Step 3: Add potatoes and continue simmering until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.",
        "Step 4: Whisk remaining 1/2 cup water and flour together until smooth; stir into beef mixture. Continue cooking and stirring until mixture thickens; transfer into a 3-quart casserole dish.",
        "Step 5: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).",
        "Step 6: Roll out pastry slightly larger than top of casserole dish; place pastry over beef mixture, and trim to leave a 1-inch overhang on all sides. Fold under, and flute against inside edge of casserole, then cut several slits in the crust to allow steam to escape.",
        "Step 7: Bake pie in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes."
