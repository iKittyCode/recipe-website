        "Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.",
        "Step 2: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; season with garlic powder, black pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Reduce heat to low. Stir 1/2 cup ketchup into beef.",
        "Step 3: Lay 1 tortilla onto a work surface; place about 1/3 cup beef mixture and 1/4 cup shredded cheese onto tortilla in a line across the middle. Roll tortilla over filling, fold in top and bottom to enclose filling, and finish rolling into a burrito shape. Place filled tortilla into the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Sprinkle remaining Mexican cheese blend on tacos. Cover dish with aluminum foil.",
        "Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven until tacos are heated through and cheese topping has melted, 20 to 25 minutes. Combine sour cream and 1/3 cup ketchup in a bowl. Top each taco with sauce."
