        "Step 4: Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, melted butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep.",
        "Step 5: Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.",
        "Step 6: Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.",
        "Step 7: Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool.",
        "Step 8: Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.",
