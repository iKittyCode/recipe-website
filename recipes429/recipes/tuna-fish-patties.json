        "Step 2: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, spinach, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion softens, about 5 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Mix the onion mixture with softened bread, tuna, mushrooms, zucchini, celery, eggs, dill, salt, pepper, basil, and oregano in a large bowl until combined. Form the mixture into about 24 thin, palm-size patties.",

        "Step 5: If you have pre-sliced bread from the store, that can be used as well; you just have to use more of it, so probably about 5 or 6 slices."
