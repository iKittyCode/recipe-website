        "Step 1: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; add potatoes, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; steam dry, 1 to 2 minutes.",
        "Step 2: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.",
        "Step 3: Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate; discard grease. Melt butter in the same skillet; add onions. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Return bacon to the skillet. Add wine; simmer until nearly evaporated. Remove from heat.",
        "Step 4: Place 1/2 potatoes into the prepared dish; spread 1/2 bacon mixture over top. Layer in remaining potatoes, spread crème fraîche over top, then add remaining 1/2 bacon mixture. Remove and discard rind from Reblochon. Cut cheese into thin slices; layer evenly over top of casserole.",
        "Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and slightly browned, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve hot."
