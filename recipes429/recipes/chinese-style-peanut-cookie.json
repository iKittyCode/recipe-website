        "¾ cup roasted peanuts, finely ground",
        "1 cup all-purpose flour",
        "¼ cup corn flour",
        "1 ¼ cups confectioners' sugar",

        "Step 1: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.",
        "Step 2: Stir together the peanuts, flour, corn flour, and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl until well-combined. Make a well in the center of the peanut mixture. Slowly pour in the vegetable oil and mix with the peanut mixture to make a wet, slightly sticky dough. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of dough per cookie, and roll into balls about 1/2-inch in diameter. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets, and brush each with egg yolk, if desired.",
        "Step 3: Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool on racks."
