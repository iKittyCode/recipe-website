        "Step 6: Roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the skillet as before.",
        "Step 7: Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.",
        "Step 8: Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve."
