        "Step 2: Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
        "Step 3: Coat chicken in teriyaki marinade and cook on the prepared grill until no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",

        "Step 5: Place broccoli and red pepper strips in a grill basket and grill, turning occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.",
        "Step 6: Grill pineapple until soft and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.",
        "Step 7: Slice pineapple and chicken into 1-inch cubes. In 4 separate bowls layer rice, chicken, pineapple, broccoli, and red peppers. Garnish each bowl with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce over each bowl if desired."
