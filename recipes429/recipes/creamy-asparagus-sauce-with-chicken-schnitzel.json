        "Step 1: Place asparagus spears in a saucepan and mash with a fork. Add cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 20 minutes. Cover and keep warm.",
        "Step 2: Place chicken between 2 sheets of plastic on a work surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even thickness. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Step 3: Add flour to a large, flat dish. Beat eggs thoroughly in a shallow bowl. Add bread crumbs to another large, flat dish.",
        "Step 4: Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, dip in beaten eggs, and coat with bread crumbs.",
        "Step 5: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook breaded chicken in batches until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with asparagus cream sauce.",
        "Step 6: Chicken can be grilled instead of breaded and pan-fried.",
        "Step 7: Cook chicken schnitzel in butter instead of oil, if preferred."
