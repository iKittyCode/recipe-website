    "method": [
        "Step 1: Add chicken, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onions, garlic, and bread crumbs to a bowl, and use a fork to gently but thoroughly mix everything together. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before shaping.",
        "Step 2: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and lightly grease the foil.",
        "Step 3: Divide meatball mixture into 16 portions (about 2 rounded tablespoons each), and transfer onto the prepared pan. Using damp hands, roll each portion into a smooth meatball; and space out evenly on the baking sheet.",
        "Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meatballs will be just cooked through, and an instant read thermometer inserted near the center will read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C).",
        "Step 5: Let cool; wrap and keep in the refrigerator until needed. These can be made the day before.",
        "Step 6: Preheat an outdoor grill, preferably charcoal, for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir ketchup, hoisin, fresh ginger, and rice vinegar together in a small bowl, and set aside.",
        "Step 7: Place 4 meatballs on each skewer, and grill until lightly charred and heated through, about 3 minutes per side. Turn over, and brush with glaze. Turn back over, so the brushed side is down, and let sear for about 30 seconds; meanwhile, brush top with glaze.",
        "Step 8: Turn over once more and let sear for about 30 seconds; remove from the heat. Apply more glaze after removing from the grill, as desired. Serve immediately."
