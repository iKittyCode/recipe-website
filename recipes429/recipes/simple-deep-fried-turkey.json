    "ingredients": [
        "3 Â½ gallons peanut oil for frying",
        "1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed",
        "1 tablespoon salt, or to taste",
        "1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.",
        "Step 2: Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter.",
        "Step 3: Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside.",
        "Step 4: Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first. Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey.",
        "Step 5: Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.",
        "Step 6: Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.",
        "Step 7: We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used."
