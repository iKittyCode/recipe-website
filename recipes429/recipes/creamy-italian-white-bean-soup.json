        "Step 2: Stir in beans, chicken broth, pepper, thyme, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Use a slotted spoon to remove 2 cups of bean and vegetable mixture from soup; set aside.",
        "Step 4: Blend remaining soup in small batches in a blender at low speed until smooth — it helps to remove the center piece of the blender lid to allow steam to escape.",
        "Step 5: Pour blended soup back into pot; stir in reserved beans.",
        "Step 6: Bring soup to a boil, occasionally stirring. Stir in spinach and until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.",
        "Step 7: Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat. Serve soup with freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top."
