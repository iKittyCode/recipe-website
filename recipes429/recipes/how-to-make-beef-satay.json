        "Step 1: Whisk together brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, onion, oil, soy sauce, coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth.",
        "Step 2: Bruise lemongrass by hitting it lightly several times with the back of a large chef's knife; mince lemongrass and add to marinade.",
        "Step 3: Cut beef sirloin into strips about 2 1/2-inches long and 1/8 inch-thick. Stir beef into marinade until beef is completely coated, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.",
        "Step 4: Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.",
        "Step 5: Remove beef from marinade and shake off excess marinade. Thread 1/4 of the meat onto each metal skewer. Discard remaining marinade.",
        "Step 6: Arrange skewers on the preheated grill; cook until meat stops sticking to the grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip skewers and continue cooking until meat is well browned and shows grill marks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Flip skewers once more; cook until meat is still slightly pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter; let rest for 2 minutes before serving."
