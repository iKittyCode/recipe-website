        "Step 5: Pour wine mixture into the skillet and cook until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Pour 1 ladleful reserved pasta water into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Stir in pine nuts and red pepper flakes; simmer until flavors combine and sauce is reduced, about 5 minutes.",
        "Step 6: Stir bucatini and sardines into the skillet. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring frequently and adding more reserved pasta water as necessary, until sauce and pasta are heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.",
        "Step 7: Ladle into bowls and top with fennel fronds and toasted bread crumbs."
