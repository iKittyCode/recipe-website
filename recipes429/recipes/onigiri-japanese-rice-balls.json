    "ingredients": [
        "4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice",
        "5 ½ cups water, divided",
        "¼ teaspoon salt",
        "¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)",
        "2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips",
        "2 tablespoons sesame seeds"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.",
        "Step 2: Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.",
        "Step 3: Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice."
