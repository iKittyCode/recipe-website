        "Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.",
        "Step 2: Whisk coconut milk, milk, and 1 cup sugar in a medium saucepan. Mix water and cornstarch in a separate bowl until smooth. Bring coconut mixture to a boil; reduce to a simmer and slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Continue stirring over low heat until thickened, about 3 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, about 1 minute. Divide coconut pudding evenly into two bowls. Stir chocolate into one portion; spread on the bottom of the pie crust. Pour the remaining portion of pudding on top of the chocolate and spread smooth. Refrigerate pie for about 1 hour.",
        "Step 4: Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until frothy. Add sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Layer the cream on top of pie."
