        "Step 1: Place rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches; swirl with your fingers, then drain. Repeat until water runs clear, about 3 times.",
        "Step 2: Combine rice, 1 1/2 cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Chill, uncovered, 2 to 4 hours or overnight.",

Add rice and spread in an even layer; cook, without stirring, until lightly browned and crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Add fish sauce; cook, stirring, until fully combined and heated through, about 2 minutes."
