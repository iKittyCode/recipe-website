        "¾ teaspoon kosher salt",
        "1 cup granulated sugar",
        "½ cup unsalted butter or margarine, softened",
        "2 large eggs, room temperature",
        "2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "½ cup whole milk, room temperature",
        "½ cup strawberry or raspberry preserves",

    "method": [
        "Step 1: Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray; line bottoms with parchment paper. Lightly spray parchment paper with baking spray.",
        "Step 2: Sift flour, cornstarch, and baking powder into a medium bowl; whisk in salt and set aside.",
        "Step 3: Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. (The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.)",
        "Step 4: Beat in eggs, one at a time, on medium speed, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next, 1 to 2 minutes total. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating until just combined after each addition.",
        "Step 5: Evenly divide batter between prepared pans and spread into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Firmly tap pans on a kitchen towel-lined counter several times to help get rid of any large bubbles in the batter.",
        "Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. Let stand, parchment side down, on wire racks until cooled completely, about 1 hour.",
        "Step 7: Remove and discard parchment paper. Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate. Stir preserves in a small bowl until mostly smooth; spread in an even layer over cake.",
        "Step 8: To make vanilla whipped cream: Whisk heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract by hand in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.",
        "Step 9: Dollop over jam, then spread into an even layer.",
        "Step 10: Top with remaining cake layer. Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with strawberries (if using)."
