        "Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart baking dish.",
        "Step 2: Place milk, 1/3 cup sugar, flour, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk thoroughly to blend and break up any lumps. Whisk in eggs and vanilla until custard well blended. Ladle about 1/2 custard into the prepared baking dish.",
        "Step 3: Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Scatter cherries evenly on top of set custard; sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Ladle in remaining 1/2 custard, trying to avoid rearranging cherries.",
