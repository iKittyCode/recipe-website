    "ingredients": [
        "1 (14 ounce) package sweetened shredded coconut",
        "2 (6 ounce) packages slivered almonds",
        "1 (14 ounce) box crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex®)",
        "1 (12 ounce) box honey graham cereal (such as Golden Grahams®)",
        "2 cups white sugar",
        "2 cups corn syrup",
        "1 ½ cups unsalted butter"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Step 2: Spread coconut on a baking sheet. Spread almonds on a separate baking sheet.",
        "Step 3: Bake coconut and almonds in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove baking sheets from the oven and stir. Continue baking, stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, until coconut and almonds are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes total.",
        "Step 4: Combine coconut, almonds, rice cereal, and honey graham cereal together in a large bowl. Set aside.",
        "Step 5: Bring white sugar, corn syrup, and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from water and placed on a flat surface, about 10 minutes.",
        "Step 6: Pour sugar-butter mixture over cereal mixture and stir until well coated. Divide mixture between 2 baking sheets to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent clumping."
