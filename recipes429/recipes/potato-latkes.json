        "3 medium russet potatoes, peeled",
        "1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste",
        "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",

    "method": [
        "Step 1: Gather all ingredients.",
        "Step 2: Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.",
        "Step 3: Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.",
        "Step 4: Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.",
        "Step 5: Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot."
