        "Step 1: Gather all ingredients. Grease bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish or disposable aluminum pan.",
        "Step 2: Cut Hawaiian rolls in half; arrange 24 bottom halves in the prepared baking dish.",
        "Step 3: Whisk melted butter, Dijon mustard, onion powder, poppy seeds, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; brush 1/2 over bottom halves.",
        "Step 4: Layer pulled pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and 2 pickle chips on each bottom roll, in exact order.",
        "Step 5: Cover with roll tops. Brush remaining 1/2 butter mixture over tops; cover dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
        "Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove foil; press sliders with a spatula to flatten. Continue baking until sliders are heated through and top is crispy, about 15 minutes more.",
        "Step 7: Carnitas also work well instead of the pulled pork in this recipe."
