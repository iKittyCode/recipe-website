    "ingredients": [
        "4 slices white bread, torn into pieces",
        "2 tablespoons milk",
        "1 clove garlic",
        "1  onion, quartered",
        "4 teaspoons dried mint",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "ground black pepper to taste",
        "½ pound ground beef",
        "½ pound ground lamb",
        "4  eggs",
        "½ cup all-purpose flour for dredging",
        "vegetable oil for frying"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Step 1: Moisten the bread pieces with the milk in a large bowl, and set aside.",
        "Step 2: Mince the garlic in a food processor, then add the onion, mint, salt, and pepper. Process until the onion is finely chopped.",
        "Step 3: Add the onion mixture to the bowl with the moist bread, along with the beef, lamb, and eggs. Mix with your hands until thoroughly blended.",
        "Step 4: Roll the mixture into balls measuring 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.",
        "Step 5: Place the flour in a shallow pan, and roll the balls in the flour to coat. Shake off any excess flour, and place the meatballs onto a plate or baking sheet, pressing to flatten slightly. This will keep them from rolling away.",
        "Step 6: Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs, 8 or 10 at a time, and cook until nicely browned on the outside, and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.",
        "Step 7: Drain meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining meatballs."
