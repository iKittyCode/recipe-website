    "method": [
        "Step 1: Mix ground lamb, cinnamon, cumin, salt, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, turmeric, and curry powder together in a bowl. Cover and put in the refrigerator for 2 hours to overnight.",
        "Step 2: Melt butter in a soup pot over medium-high heat; stir in onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened and turned translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add spiced lamb mixture. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Add consomme, diced tomatoes, beef broth, chicken broth, and honey. Stir in carrots, sweet potatoes, garbanzo beans, lentils, apricots, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.",
        "Step 4: Bring soup just to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils and vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "Step 5: Barley can be used in place of lentils, and dried cranberries can be used in place of apricots.",
        "Step 6: To make this soup ahead, I suggest not cooking the soup fully until just before serving it, so that the vegetables stay firm while frozen. Follow steps 1 to 3, then transfer soup to a freezer-safe container. Place in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze. When ready to eat, if refrigerated, simply transfer to a pot and follow step 4. If frozen, thaw in the the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours, pour into a soup pot, and follow step 4."
