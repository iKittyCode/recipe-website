        "½ cup all-purpose flour",
        "2 cups milk",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "1 pinch nutmeg",
        "1 pound feta cheese",
        "4 large eggs, beaten",
        "3 ounces grated Greek Kefalotiri cheese",

    "method": [
        "Step 1: Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually pour in milk, stirring constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon. Add salt and nutmeg, stirring occasionally, until white sauce is bubbly and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Step 2: Mash feta cheese in a large bowl with a fork; stir in beaten eggs, grated kefalotiri, and parsley. Pour in hot white sauce and mix well.",
        "Step 3: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter.",
        "Step 4: Line the prepared baking dish with a sheet of phyllo dough and brush it with melted butter; keep remaining phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap while you work. Repeat with 1/2 of the phyllo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter, and letting them come up the sides of the baking dish. Pour in cheese filling.",
        "Step 5: Lay remaining pastry sheets on top of filling, brushing each with butter. Brush the top of the last sheet with butter, then use a sharp knife to score the top sheets into strips about 3 inches wide from one end of the baking dish to the other.",
        "Step 6: Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes, then cut into squares and serve hot."
