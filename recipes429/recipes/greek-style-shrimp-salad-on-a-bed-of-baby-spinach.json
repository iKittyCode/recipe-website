        "Step 1: Thread shrimp onto metal skewers (or bamboo ones that have been soaked in water for 15 minutes). Brush both sides with oil and season with salt, pepper and a light sprinkling of sugar.",
        "Step 2: Heat gas grill, with all burners on high, until fully preheated, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a wire brush to clean grill rack, then brush lightly with oil. Close lid and allow to return to temperature. Grill shrimp until fully cooked and spotty brown, about 2 minutes per side.",
        "Step 3: Meanwhile, mix in a medium bowl the tomatoes, cheese, olives, oregano, 2 Tbs. of the olive oil and 2 tsps. of the vinegar. Unthread shrimp and add to bowl. Lightly toss ingredients to coat. Set aside. (Can be made an hour or so ahead.)",
        "Step 4: When ready to serve, drizzle remaining oil, as well as a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper, over spinach in a large bowl. Toss to coat. Add remaining 2 tsps. vinegar; toss again. Divide spinach among 4 large plates. Top with a portion of the shrimp mixture.",
