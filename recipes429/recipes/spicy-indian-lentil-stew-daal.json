        "Step 1: Rinse the yellow lentils, red lentils, and mung beans and put them in a medium saucepan with 5 cups water, salt, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon ghee. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are easily mashed, about 30 minutes.",
        "Step 2: Heat remaining ghee in a frying pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until they sputter. Add onion, chile peppers, and ginger; stir-fry until onions are soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and add cilantro and cayenne. Transfer mixture to lentils.",
        "Step 3: Let mixture simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.",
        "Step 4: Any type of spicy pepper can be used in place of the chiles. For a milder dish, adjust or leave out the chiles and cayenne.",
        "Step 5: This recipe is quite forgiving, and you can substitute types of lentils or spices according to what you have on hand. You can use oil instead of ghee."
