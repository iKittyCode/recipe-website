    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup warm milk",
        "¼ cup vegetable oil",
        "¼ cup fine white sugar",
        "1 medium egg",
        "2 teaspoons instant yeast",
        "½ teaspoon salt",

        "3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted",

    "method": [
        "Step 1: Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky. Return dough to the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
        "Step 2: Press dough down gently. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent dough from drying.",
        "Step 3: Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter; cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining dough balls.",
        "Step 4: Heat 2-inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium heat.",
        "Step 5: Working in batches, fry dough in hot oil until puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip dough and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
        "Step 6: We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used."
